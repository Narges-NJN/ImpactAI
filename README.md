## A professional diabetes assistant with personalized meal plans

## üìñ Introduction  

### **The Problem**  
Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions affecting millions of people worldwide. Managing diabetes in daily life is a constant challenge that requires individuals to monitor their blood sugar levels, adhere to strict dietary plans, schedule medications, and stay physically active. Despite advancements in healthcare, many people with diabetes struggle with time management, education on their condition, and access to personalized tools to simplify their routine.  

The growing demands of modern life, coupled with the lack of easily accessible resources, make it difficult for people to manage their condition effectively. This gap in support systems inspired the development of our **Diabetes Management Bot**, a convenient and personalized tool designed to assist individuals in maintaining control over their diabetes.
